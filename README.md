# The Beer Chart

Check it out [here](http://www.thebeerchart.com).

## Description
The Beer Chart is a responsive full-stack app that allows users to learn about mankind's greatest invention: beer! They can keep track of beers they've had, as well as discover new kinds. This is my capstone project for the Thinkful bootcamp.

## Built With
* [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [React](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)

## Getting Started
It's easy to get started! Register a new account to add notes to the beers, or just browse anonymously.

## API
The frontend accesses the backend using authenticated ajax calls, retrieving data from an mLab database.
