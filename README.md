# The Beer Chart

Check it out [here](http://www.thebeerchart.com).


The Beer Chart is a responsive full-stack app that allows users to learn about mankind's greatest invention: beer! They can keep track of beers they've had, as well as discover new kinds.

This is my capstone project for the Thinkful bootcamp. It's built with React, React Router, Express, MongoDB, and Material UI.
