# The Beer Chart

Check it out [here](http://www.thebeerchart.com).

This is the front-end of my full-stack capstone project for the Thinkful bootcamp. It's built with React and connects to a back-end with Node and MongoDB.

I wanted to provide a simple way for people to learn about beer. Rather than have a series of fragmented sites, I put it all together one chart, where you can keep track of what you've tried and discover everything that you haven't. Enjoy!
